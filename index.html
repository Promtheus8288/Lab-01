            <p>
                My perfered last name is Comella. 
                I am 18 years old and am going to collage. 
                I attend Georgian Collage. 
                Before that I attended Bear Creek Secondary School.
                And before even that I have attended 3 seperate elementary schools.
                Baxter elementary school, DR. S. J. Phillips publice school, and another one somewhere I can't remember.
                
                Right now in school I am currently in the course called Computer Programming and Analysis.
                I am thinking about taking the Artificial Intellagence Course after this one.
                I may take another after that if I find one that catches my interest

                Off topic a bit, but I am an advid reader.
                Right now i am reading a fanfiction based off of the amazing web novel called Worm by Wildbow.
                Over a million words.
                It was the longest book I have ever read, but I enjoyed every bit of it.
                I am also pround to anouce that in our little community we have over 10,000 fanfiction written about the book.
